# About Me

I'm a Graduate Research Assistant pursuing a Master's in Information Technology at [Multimedia University Malaysia](https://www.mmu.edu.my). Currently immersed in cutting-edge AI tech, my focus centers on a thesisâ€”**'Utility Pole Safety Assessment from Visual Data'**, addressing the under-researched field of utility pole detection and safety Assessment. At [Telekom Malaysia R&D](https://www.tmrnd.com.my), I mainly implemented computer vision models and assess them. Previously, as a Full Stack Developer in the Telecom industry, I developed Microservices and APIs. Eager to blend academic insights with practical industry impact.
